  ///                  (sometimes may differ from the compiled keyboard)
  ///   - regionName - the name of the region to group the keyboard under
  ///   - legacyId   - the legacy filename of the keyboard, used only
  ///                  during upgrades
  /// The file is sorted according to how the keyboards should be
